**Description:** *Our application help travelers get information regarding the cheapest flight and popular places to go out and eat* 

**Motivation:** *Started out as means of traveling easy; by entering a destination we were attempting to make travel easier for the user by quantifying the price of travel, averaging the prices for food, flights, and hotel-room prices.*

**Result:** *The used the Yelp API to provide several popular options for Food. Yelp provides the dollar amount, rating of the establishment and address. Skyscanner provided the flight information and firebase database provides the storage of data and the authentication process.*

**Team Efforts:** *Conner was responsible for the UI which he developed with the Materialize framework. Marissa, Toneth and Victor were responsible for the API use to retrieve the information. Frank was responsible to the storage of data and authentication.* 

**Individual Responsibilities:** *I was responsible for writing the code that stored the information retrieve from the Yelp and Skyscanner API as well as the authentication (user data storage login, logout, and signup) process in Firebase* 

**Challenges:** *One of challenges was the initial process with the google API which we decided not to use because it requires a payment and we could not get any support from google. Additionally, `I did not realize the amount effort` and work needed to develop the authentication process. I had to use the firebase cloud database for authentication and the standard firebase for the storage.*

**Improvements:** *We will like to improve the results of the APIâ€™s and merge the storage an authentication databases*
